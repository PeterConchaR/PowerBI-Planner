# PowerBI-Planner
A Power BI template file that imports plans exported from Microsoft Planner
Supported languages are English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portugues (Brazilian) and Russian


Please note - your exported excel files need to be in a folder with no other files.  Power BI imports all the files in that folder, and if other files exist in there this will break the import.
