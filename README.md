Please note - your exported excel files need to be in a folder with no other files.  Power BI imports all the files in that folder, and if other files exist in there this will break the import.

Known issues - if you are not using a date format of DD-MM-YYYY you will need to change the regional settings to match your format once you have imported the template into PowerBI.  The setting is within the file | options dialogue box of Power BI.
